# XDebug Docker
XDebug running in a Docker container.

## Getting Started
Make a note of the local IP address of your machine. If you're on a Mac or a Linux machine `ifconfig` will tell you.

Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure your IP is entered after `remote_host=`.

Start the container:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
